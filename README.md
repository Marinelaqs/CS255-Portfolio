_Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?_

DriverPass is a system that is designed to help new drivers pass their driver's exam. It is meant to be a combination of a learning management system and appointment system to give students a way to study, check grades, and take mock tests and schedule in-person lessons with a driver.

_What did you do particularly well?_

I think I learned and adapted to a new way of thinking. I'm not used to looking at a system in the way that we did in this class. Particularly, I usually didn't actively think about the different types of requirements and limitations. They were usually in the back on my mind when I was planning out a system, but not written down in a way that others could understand. I think learning this was super beneficial to me. 

_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_

I would improve the overall write-up of the requirements. I think I did a good job in the second project, but the requirements part of the first project could definitely be improved. I would go more in-depth and tweak the limitations so they are more in-line with what some actual limitations may be. I don't think I put good ones in there to be honest.

_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_

I wanted to look into the big picture of how those requirements linked to the system. I used the customer interview to understand and layout what the customer needs and how I will transform that into the system. By considering these needs, we are making sure that we are making the system the customer wants and needs so they are happy.

_How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?_

I approach software using a funnel method. I start big then move into the small. I think this is a good appraoch for designing a system as well. It allows me to not get caught up in the weeds of miniscule details and lose sight of what I will neeed to accomplish the customer's goals. I would add in the different diagram types as well since they can be super helpful to get the team and customer on the same page of what our ideas are.
